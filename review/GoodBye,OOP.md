[Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53)


The author pointed out pitfalls of OOP's three pillars

* inherantance
   Banana monkey jungle problesm. To use one class,  have to know the father class, grandfather class, and ..
   diamond problems. Cann't fix the problems of two father and one son share the same function
   Have to be white box for the base class, or something bad might happen
   Hierarchy problems: Not all the real world models can used hierarchy model. Tag is better. 
* encapsulation
   Cann't fully encapsulate since the reference problems.
* polymophism
   It’s not that Polymorphism isn’t great, it’s just that you don’t need an Object Oriented language to get this.
